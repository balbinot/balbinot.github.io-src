I am a astrophysicist working with resolved stellar populations in the nearby
Universe. I mainly use statistical tools to mine for faint signal in large
databases coming from photometric and astrometric surveys. Ultimately I find
and model dwarf galaxies and stellar streams, which have only a handful of
stars among billions of contaminating ones.

I also have a variety of interests in neighboring fields such as multiple
populations in globular clusters, the structure and star formation of the LMC,
open clusters, and collisional dynamics. 

More recently I have been involved in large spectroscopic surveys such as
[WEAVE](https://ingconfluence.ing.iac.es:8444/confluence//display/WEAV/The+WEAVE+Project)
and
[4MOST](https://www.eso.org/public/teles-instr/paranal-observatory/surveytelescopes/vista/4most/).
