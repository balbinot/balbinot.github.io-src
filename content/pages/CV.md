## Short bio

I was born in Porto Alegre, the capital of the state of Rio Grande do Sul in
Brazil. I did my BSc (Physics), MSc (Astronomy), and PhD at Universidade
Federal do Rio Grande do Sul. During most of undergrad I was supervised by
Prof. Basilio Santiago and worked in a variety of topics such as globular
clusters, dwarf galaxies, stellar streams, and survey design and preparation.
After my PhD in 2014 I moved to a 4-year postdoctoral research position at the
University of Surrey (Guildford, UK), to work with Prof. Mark Gieles. There I
focussed mainly on the dynamics of globular clusters and dwarf galaxies,
heavily linked to large photometric/astrometric surveys. Since 2018 I have been
working on galactic archeology as a postdoc with Prof. Amina Helmi at the
Kapteyn Institute in the University of Groninge (NL). My main focus now is on
Gaia and near-future spectroscopic surveys, such as WEAVE and 4MOST.
