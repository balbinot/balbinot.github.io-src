>Globular clusters are some of the oldest bound stellar structures observed in
>the Universe. They are ubiquitous in large galaxies and are believed to trace
>intense star-formation events and the hierarchical build-up of structure.
>Observations of globular clusters in the Milky Way, and a wide variety of other
>galaxies, have found evidence for a `metallicity floor', whereby no globular
>clusters are found with chemical (metal) abundances below approximately 0.3 to
>0.4 per cent of that of the Sun. The existence of this metallicity floor may
>reflect a minimum mass and a maximum redshift for surviving globular clusters
>to form—both critical components for understanding the build-up of mass in the
>Universe. Here we report measurements from the Southern Stellar Streams
>Spectroscopic Survey of the spatially thin, dynamically cold Phoenix stellar
>stream in the halo of the Milky Way. The properties of the Phoenix stream are
>consistent with it being the tidally disrupted remains of a globular cluster.
>However, its metal abundance ([Fe/H] = -2.7) is substantially below the
>empirical metallicity floor. The Phoenix stream thus represents the debris of
>the most metal-poor globular clusters discovered so far, and its progenitor is
>distinct from the present-day globular cluster population in the local
>Universe. Its existence implies that globular clusters below the metallicity
>floor have probably existed, but were destroyed during Galactic evolution.



The Phoenix stream was the first stream discovered using Dark Enegy Survey data
(see my [2016
publication](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...820...58B/abstract)).
Since then it was followed-up by the S⁵ collaboration and it turned out to be
the most metal-poor globular cluster remnant in the Galaxy.  Read more in Zhen
Wan's paper. The paper pre-print can be found

Metallicity versus spectroscopic signal-to-noise ratio for Phoenix stream members. A
histogram of the metallicities of Phoenix member stars with signal-to-noise ratios greater than 10 is
presented in orange (right axis); the metallicity distribution for individual globular clusters in the
Milky Way is shown in blue 4
(right axis). The signal-to-noise ratios of individual Phoenix members
are also shown in black points (left axis) with errorbars (1σ; see ref.13 for detail discussion). The
dashed line indicates the location of the empirical ‘metallicity floor’ at [Fe/H] = −2.5, above which
sit all globular clusters in the Milky Way, the Local Group and other nearby galaxies. [Source: the paper]
