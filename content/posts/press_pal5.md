> Palomar 5 is one of the sparsest star clusters in the Galactic halo and is
> best-known for its spectacular tidal tails, spanning over 20 degrees across the
> sky. With N-body simulations we show that both distinguishing features can
> result from a stellar-mass black hole population, comprising ~20% of the
> present-day cluster mass. In this scenario, Palomar 5 formed with a "normal"
> black hole mass fraction of a few per cent, but stars were lost at a higher
> rate than black holes, such that the black hole fraction gradually increased.
> This inflated the cluster, enhancing tidal stripping and tail formation. A
> gigayear from now, the cluster will dissolve as a 100% black hole cluster.
> Initially denser clusters end up with lower black hole fractions, smaller
> sizes, and no observable tails. Black hole-dominated, extended star clusters
> are therefore the likely progenitors of the recently discovered thin stellar
> streams in the Galactic halo.

### All sky view

Below is a all sky view in galactic coordinates. The number of stars is higher
in brighter regions. Most of the image, where the Milky Way plane is visible (b
= 0 degrees) is produces using [Gaia
eDR3](https://sci.esa.int/web/gaia/-/28820-summary) data. The small patch in
the top-centre shows a region where deeper [DESI Legacy Imaging Survey
(DECaLS)](https://www.legacysurvey.org/dr9/description/) data is available,
which allows for Palomar 5 and its tidal tails to be seen.

### Equatorial view

A map of the sky showing in color-scale the number of stars in a region around
Palomar 5. This map was constructed using DECaLS DR9, which was processed
in a similar to way to what Bonaca and collaborators did in their [2019
paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020ApJ...889...70B/abstract).

### Night sky view

If we were able to see the very faint stars of Palomar 5 and its tidal tails,
they would look like the image below. We represent stars as circles with size
proportional to their brightness and colour proportional to their true colour.
In this figure we heavily filtered
Palomar 5 stars from the interloping background of regular Milky Way stars
using the matched-filter technique [Balbinot et al.
(2011)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011MNRAS.416..393B/abstract).
